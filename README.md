# Fuel Cell Monitoring PCB – ESP32-S3

**Master’s Project | Hochschule Wismar (HS Wismar)**

This repository contains the hardware design of a **Fuel Cell Monitoring and Measurement Board** developed as part of my Master’s project.  
The board is designed to monitor key electrical parameters of a PEM fuel cell system and interface with an **ESP32-S3** microcontroller.
